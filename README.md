# GANOS
A LWJGL Game &amp; Basic Engine built in Java

For the Summer Project of 2018 I set out to work on improving my knowledge of Graphics API's such as OpenGL, so I picked up LWJGL.

GANOS, ( Game and Name of Society ), is a fun personal coding project to work on a basic Game using a personal built engine.
